Package containing a talk on gWidgetsWWW2 at the useR2012 conference, June 2012 at Vanderbilt
=============================================================================================


The talk used `gWidgetsWWW2` to create web pages for the presentation -- not so great for sharing, as a simple pdf file would have been. This package is meant to rectify that.

To use it should be easy -- if you have `devtools` installed!

```
    install_github("gWidgetsWWW2", "jverzani")
    install_github(useR2012talk, "jverzani")
    require("useR2012talk")
```
